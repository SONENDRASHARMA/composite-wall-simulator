#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). On both sides of this electric heater, there exist two mild steel plates which are accompanied by plates of Bakelite and wood.The composite sections are pressed with the help of clamps. Thermocouples are placed at the center line of each junction faces to measure its temperature.Top and bottom surfaces are insulated so that heat can flow through thickness of plates only

<br/>
<u> <b>Simulatur: </b> </u>
<br>
First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings.When the simulator starts , heat starts conducting from heater through mild steel, wood plates towards the outer surface of wood plate and finally heat will be convected from outer surface of wood plate to atmospheric air. simulator will provide temperature value at all junctions ( heater -mild steel, Mild Steel-bakelite, Bakelite- Wood. Based on temperature gradient, finally simulator will provide thermal conductivity of Mild steel, Bakelite, Wood.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  Student will switch on the power button | Start the machine. Main switch will be converted into red. | The main purpose is to provide power supply to the apparatus.
2.| Student will set the appropriate value of voltage and current | Voltmeter and ammeter will show the values of voltage and ammeter by moving pointer  | The main purpose is to provide appropriate amount of heat to the workpiece (Q=VI)
3.| Student will Click on the Results and wait for the steady state and note down the temperature | ‘Temperature value will be displayed '  | The main purpose is to observe the temperature values at different points( heater -mild  steel junction, Mild Steel-bakelite junction, Bakelite- Wood junction , outer surface of wood)
