#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
As thermal conductivity of a material is constant, User already knows the thermal conductivities of Mild Steel, Bakelite and Wood and. Simulator is going to determine the thermal conductivities of the above mentioned materials by using Fouriers law of conduction.In this way Fourier’s law of conduction is also verified through this experiment.

Simulator will display the bar chart showing the values of thermal conductivities of different materials. User can calculate the thermal conductivities of these materials by using Fouriers law of conduction. In this way  user can asses his knowledge of 1-D Steady State heat conduction.Viva voice will also judge , the understanding level of user.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  Student will switch on the power button | Start the machine. Main switch will be converted into red. | The main purpose is to provide power supply to the apparatus.
2.| Student will set the appropriate value of voltage and current | Voltmeter and ammeter will show the values of voltage and ammeter by moving pointer  | The main purpose is to provide appropriate amount of heat to the workpiece (Q=VI)
3.| Student will Click on the Results and wait for the steady state and note down the temperature | ‘Temperature value will be displayed '  | The main purpose is to observe the temperature values at different points( heater -mild  steel junction, Mild Steel-bakelite junction, Bakelite- Wood junction , outer surface of wood)
4.| Student will note down the Thermal conductivities of all three materials | A bar chart showing the thermal conductivity of all materials will be displayed  | The main purpose is that student can verify and understand the concepts of I-D Steady state heat conduction and verify Fouriers law of heat conduction.
