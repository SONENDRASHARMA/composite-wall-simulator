#### 1. Focus Area : Heat and Mass Transfer (Thermal Engineering)
By this experiment ,  we want students to understand the the heat transfer mechanism by conduction and basics of 1-D steady state heat conduction through composite plane wall and verify Fouriers Law of Conduction.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> As per Handout
###### Assessment Method: Assessment could be done on the basis of viva-voce

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br>
The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). On both sides of this electric heater, there exist two mild steel plates which are accompanied by plates of Bakelite and wood.The composite sections are pressed with the help of clamps. Thermocouples are placed at the center line of each junction faces to measure its temperature.Top and bottom surfaces are insulated so that heat can flow through thickness of plates only

<br/>
<u> <b>Simulatur: </b> </u>
<br>
First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings.When the simulator starts , heat starts conducting from heater through mild steel, wood plates towards the outer surface of wood plate and finally heat will be convected from outer surface of wood plate to atmospheric air. simulator will provide temperature value at all junctions ( heater -mild steel, Mild Steel-bakelite, Bakelite- Wood. Based on temperature gradient, finally simulator will provide thermal conductivity of Mild steel, Bakelite, Wood.
