## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Conduction-Experiment on Composite plane wall

### 1. Story Outline:

The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). On both sides of this electric heater, there exist two mild steel plates which are accompanied by plates of Bakelite and wood.The composite sections are pressed with the help of clamps. Thermocouples are placed at the center line of each junction faces to measure its temperature.Top and bottom surfaces are insulated so that heat can flow through thickness of plates only

### 2. Story:

First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings.When the simulator starts , heat starts conducting from heater through mild steel, wood plates towards the outer surface of wood plate and finally heat will be convected from outer surface of wood plate to atmospheric air. Simulator will provide temperature value at all junctions ( heater -mild steel, Mild Steel-Bakelite, Bakelite- Wood. Based on temperature gradient, finally simulator will provide thermal conductivity of Mild steel, Bakelite, Wood.

	A box in which 1 circular heater in center .Heater is surrounded by Circular mild steel plate on both sides accompanies by bakelite and wood plates of circular shapes on both sides. Clamps are applied to hold these plates together. Upper and lower sides are provided with insulation to ensure I -d flow. Wires to connect heater with power supply.
	Book icon on top of right side which contains instructions to run the simulator.
	Sand-witch icon on top of left side to set the values of input voltage and current.When user provides the input voltage and current values, user will be able to see the movement of pointer in voltmeter and ammeter to input value. This will give him feeling of real life apparatus.

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
If user doesn't allow 10 minutes heating before measuring temperature to develop then steady state will not prevail and Fouriers law will not be applicable to the set up.

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
User will take approximate 2-3 minutes for understanding the procedure. Then for generating data by the help of simulator will take 2-3 minutes. In this along with generation of data student will be able to verify the basics of 1-D steady state heat conduction and  Fouriers law of conduction.After onwards for calculating result will take 6 minutes. Hence total time taken for doing experiment will be approximately 11 minutes.

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
