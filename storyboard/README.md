## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Conduction-Experiment on Composite plane wall

### 1. Story Outline:
The main objective of the experiment is to determine different thermal conductivity of three materials(Mild Steel, Bakelite, Wood) for composite plane wall apparatus .For this three circular plates are connected in series and placed on left side of a circular heater. A Composite wall consisting of three circular plates connected in series are also placed on right side of heater.

### 2. Story:
The electric power is supplied to a circular electric heater. This electric heater will convert this electric power into thermal power(heat). On both sides of this electric heater, there exist two mild steel plates which are accompanied by plates of Bakelite and wood.The composite sections are pressed with the help of clamps. Thermocouples are placed at the center line of each junction faces to measure its temperature.Top and bottom surfaces are insulated so that heat can flow through thickness of plates only. I-d steady state takes place through the system. 
Plane wall means  cross section area of heat conduction should be constant hence diameter of all plates is same .There is no heat generation inside plates Hence we will get a linear temperature gradient through the system. As thermal conductivity of mild steel is very high as compared to other 2 materials( bakelite,wood) , temperature gradient  gradient through mild steel will be low hence temperature difference(T1 -T2) will be lower. Thermal conductivity of wood and bakelite is low hence temperature drop for bakelite (T2-T3) and temperature drop for wood (T3-T4) will be large.
First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings.When the simulator starts , heat starts conducting from heater through mild steel, wood plates towards the outer surface of wood plate and finally heat will be convected from outer surface of wood plate to atmospheric air. Simulator will provide temperature value at all junctions ( heater -mild steel, Mild Steel-Bakelite, Bakelite- Wood. Based on temperature gradient, finally simulator will provide thermal conductivity of Mild steel, Bakelite, Wood
